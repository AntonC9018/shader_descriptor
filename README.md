This simple script converts glsl shader source code into c++ struct file, which can be used in code for convenience.

Currently, only some types are supported. I will add more if I need to. Custom types are also supported.

Please note that the script is VERY primitive but satisfies my current needs.

See an example in the `example` directory. Please inspect `test.bat` for instruction for running the example.
