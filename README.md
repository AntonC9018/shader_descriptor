This simple script converts glsl shader source code into c++ struct file, which can be used in code for convenience.

See an example in the `example` directory.

Currently, the only supported types are `mat4`, `vec3` and `float`. I will add more if I need to.

Please note that the script is VERY primitive but satisfies my current needs.
